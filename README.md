# Overview
- Following the workshop video and learning basic coding techniques
- From that experimented with making a p5.js sketch using 2D primitive shapes, variables, and conditionals
- Experimented with the circle() and triangle() as new 2D shapes
- Playing with using variables and conditionals to animate movement
- Created a star out of triangles with the use of triangle()
- Used Google colour picker to show RGB values to help pick out colours for the code

Comments while following the code on the workshop video. 



# Problem Solving/Code
**Creating animation**
After following the workshop video, I wanted to test with a round shape versus the rect() from the workshop video; as such, I started with the circle() shape.

Layering circles on top of each other + animation with y and x variables

Different sizes for each of the circles

Using conditionals to make the animation loop around and changing colours

Making velocity by having the circles move faster overtime with the use of a speed velocity

**Creating a star out of triangles**
I then wanted to try creating a more complicated shape by layering simple shapes together to create it. 
This then leads to creating a star made up of triangles, using triangle().

Using the triangle on the bottom to cut out the final part of the triangle

**Final coding comments**
- I found the p5.js reference heavily useful, especially the examples given under the explanations
- There wasn't anything not working well for me/not going the way I wanted due to me just experimenting with what things did; the only thing was slightly moving the x and y variables for the star to test and try to move the triangles to the right sides.
- I found drawing out the star shape and adding in coordinate points for each of the points helped in coding it out in p5.js

# Future development 
This was a very experimental project, and as such, I didn't have a clear vision of what to make, but rather, I had thoughts of how I could try to do this, etc. 
Right now, it looks somewhat like a night sky with a shooting star, perhaps developing this to look like it fully or to refine the star to look more even and proportionate.
